/Multiply A (in register 1) by (B + 2) (in register 0) and store result in register 0
/Because we cannot multiply, we will add register 1 to register 2 X times
/And decrement register 0 by adding in twos complement until it is 0
/We can then read the zero value in the processor status registry
/The branch statement will send back to line 41 until the comparison is zero
/For this to work we assume that B is greater or equal to -1
/
/We need to load -1 into register 3 to be used to decrement register 0 (B + 2)
